Specialism Radar

For this i will briefly go over the functionality of the package so you’ll have some idea of how to use it. The main public variables which are assigned are on the EnemyRadar GameObject on  the canvas. And uses Prefabs for red and green blips. These are to show Npc(green) and enemies(red) ; these two blip prefabs should be already set. The player is also set as a public variable, this is so the map can be updated with the player's location.
There is also the radar distance, so this is for the relative distance of the radar, along with how big the blip is on the radar. 

Now for displaying the objects on the radar you want The two in the image below are called enemy and npc the name should be the name of Two new tags in your scene attached to the objects that you want to be displayed for my case it’s green capsules as npc and red as enemy so that's what the layers are called and what the tags are called.
